ExampleSensor - an example dummy sensor plugin

This example demonstrates the plugin interface and
management of a color sensor device. It outputs its
actions to stdout for learning/debugging. 

See complementary example of direct libookala programming in
the apps/read_sensor/main.cpp.ExampleSensor file.

  + After installed, the plugin can be configured for use with
    ucal configuration scripts ($HOME/.config/ucal/ucal.xml):

    32-bit builds:
      <loadplugin>/usr/local/ookala/lib/libExampleSensor.so</loadplugin>

    64-bit builds:
      <loadplugin>/usr/local/ookala/lib64/libExampleSensor.so</loadplugin>
