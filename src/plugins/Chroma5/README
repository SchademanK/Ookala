X-Rite Chroma5 color sensor plugin example

Chroma5  support for X-Rite Chroma5 sensor requires:

  + X-Rite SequelLinuxSDK7_1_0 (version 7.1.0 or later) 

    http://www.xrite.com

  + This library employes Qt make (qmake) tools. When built
    on 64-bit systems, QMAKE_CFLAGS / QMAKE_CXXFLAGS may 
    require the -m64 architecture flag for proper results. 
    (Try defining QMAKE_CFLAGS with the full definition
    of QMAKE_CFLAGS_RELEASE flags - this seems to provide
    the most reliable build of the support libraries across
    tested systems.)
    [/usr/lib64/qt-X.X/mkspecs/default/qmake.conf]

  + After installed, the plugin can be configured for use with
    ucal configuration scripts (ucal.xml):

    32-bit builds:
      <loadplugin>/usr/local/ookala/lib/libChroma5.so</loadplugin>

    64-bit builds:
      <loadplugin>/usr/local/ookala/lib64/libChroma5.so</loadplugin>
