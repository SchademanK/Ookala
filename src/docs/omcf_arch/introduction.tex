\section{Introduction}

The Ookala Modular Calibration Framework (OMCF) is an open
color-calibration platform designed to support extensible,
standardized color cabibration of color-critical display
environments such as HP DreamColor Professional Displays.

The following document is a work-in-progress description
of the original plugin architecture for {\tt libookala}
that manages the plugin registry, dictionaries, plugin
chains, error handling, and color sensor plugins.
Plugin loading, queries, chain execution, grouping, and
data archiving are also covered.

The current OMCF package offers the {\tt ucal} application
and a combination of {\tt hpdc\_util} and {\tt read\_sensor} 
applets to further demonstrate this functionality.
