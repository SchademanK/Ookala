Plugin Chain Gang


--------------------------------------

Plugin Structure:
 * plugin registration 
 * registration functions
 * plugin query'ing
 * extendable functions

Plugin Chains:
 * plugin query'ing
 * example chain for mon_calib2
 * chain save and load

Plugin IPC - dictionaries:
 * dictionary save + load
 * global dictionry in the plugin registry

Parameter gathering:
 * each pi builds its gui elements

 * XXX: is this done in the chain before preRun()?

Being tied into Wx:
 * processEvents()

plugin chain execution cancelling!


Todo:
  + plugin registration is hard-coaded.
  + you can store derived classes in a dict, and
     even save them, but there's no way to load them..

  + No plugin version process
