============================================================================

The Ookala Modular Calibration Framework (OMCF) was initially developed and 
tested on HP Workstations running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). The
software was developed for the following monitor types:

  + HP DreamColor LP2480zw Professional Display

For further Linux development, installation, and test, the following
environment conditioning is required:


_____________
Prerequisites

  + automake
  + autoconf
  + libtool
  + pkgconfig

  + i2c-dev - Linux user-space interface to I2C protocol used for
              DDC/IC communications with HP DreamColor Professional Displays
            - load as kernel module at runtime

  + libusb - user-space access to USB devices (version 0.1.12 or later)
    libusb-devel - development support
            - interface used for color sensor communication
      * http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb

  + wxWidgets - a cross-platform toolkit for GUI (version 2.8.8 or later)
      * http://www.wxwidgets.org

  + X-Rite - color measurement and management provider of technologies
             such as i1(r)Display2 (eye-one) color sensors
           - also provider of Sequel/Chroma5 color technologies
             - example Chroma5 driver requires licensed code and
               hardware compatible with SequelLinuxSDK7_1_0 (version 7.1.0) 
               from X-Rite, Incorporated (Copyright (c) 2006 X-Rite, Inc.) 
             - OMCF example Chroma5 plugin published with permission from 
               X-Rite, Incorporated 
      * http://www.xrite.com

Build Scenario

  1. A sample rpm-compatible spec file is included with this distribution.
     If a customized installation is necessary, the following sample can 
     be adapted for your environment.

  2. Create target directories and populate with required components,
     e.g., wxWidgets, 3rd party sensor headers/libraries, etc.

     Ookala target directories to create:
       * /usr/local/ookala/bin
       * /usr/local/ookala/docs
       * /usr/local/ookala/icons
       * /usr/local/ookala/include
       * /usr/local/ookala/lib[64]
       * /usr/local/ookala/scripts

     wxWidgets, 3rd-party sensor headers / libraries:
       * /usr/local/bin
       * /usr/local/include
       * /usr/local/lib[64]

     wxWidgets note: we configured and built with
       configure --enable-monolithic --with-opengl --enable-shared --with-gtk

  3. Update local copy of OMCF configuration script:

     aclocal; autoconf; automake

  4. Configure OMCF for build. Unique flags of interest include:

     configure [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...

       * --x-includes                   # X11 includes location   
                                          (if undefined $x_includes)
       * --x-libraries                  # X11 library location   
                                          (if undefined $x_libraries)
       * --with-examplesensor           # ExampleSensor (dummy)
       * --with-chroma5                 # X-Rite Chroma5 (requires X-Rite
                                          licensed SDK and hardware)
       * --with-i1d2hpdc                # HP i1D2 X-Rite sensor (requires
                                          X-Rite licensed SDK)
       * --with-wx-gcc4                 # GNU g++ compiler (v4.x or later)
                                          needs help with wxWidgets

     Note: Each plugin module option includes a --with-XXX-headers=PATH
           and --with-XXX-libs=PATH option that is recommended for use
           when configuring that build.  For example, examplesensor should
           be configured with (note lib or lib64 choice):

     ---with-examplesensor \
     ---with-examplesensor-headers=/usr/local/ookala/include \
     ---with-examplesensor-libs=/usr/local/ookala/lib   

  5. build source via make command:

     make

  6. Install successful build via make command:

     make install

  7. Refresh dynamic library cache:

     ldconfig /usr/local/lib
     ldconfig /usr/local/ookala/lib[64]

  8. Copy icons to target location from icons directory:

     cp icons/* /usr/local/ookala/icons

     Documentation and additional scripts can also be copied to
     target directories as needed.
